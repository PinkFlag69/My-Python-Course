# My Python Course Notes
These are the notes that I took on the Python Course "The Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python"

You can feel free to use them as solutions, a guide, or a quick way to scan the course.

## Would I recommend it?

To that, I'd give a big yes. It's a great course and it is in plain english, unlike many of the other courses on the internet such as YouTube. The problem with the courses/videos on YouTube is their lack of interconnectedness. This course is perfect for anyone because all of the information is stored in the same place. Not only this, but the teacher is also very great, going at a slow pace and teaching each concept so that it sticks and in the right order. Obviously, it would not make sense to learn about recursion just after learning how to print. This course has very minute details in place and in a perfect order.

## Why?

I made this repo mainly for 2 reasons. 1) I can look back. I want to see how bad I was at python when I look back at this is 1,2,5 maybe 10 years. It would be great nostalgia. The other reason is for people to see what the course would be like. 

Anyways, thanks, and have fun looking around. Have a great day.
