Numbers: They are integers, both negative and positive. There are two types: floats and integers. 
Floats have decimals and integers do not .
Strings: It is a combination of charecters. They are surrounded by single or double quotation marks. 
Lists: It is a list of data types surrounded by []. It can be indexed, sliced and manipulated. 
Tuples: Similar to a list, but surrounded by paranthesis, but the objects are immutable. 
Dictionaries: It has a "key" function. It is surrounded by curly braces. Ex: {"key1":"value1:, etc}

Equation to get to 100.25 =  (((10*10)/10)**2)+10-9.75

1. Value = 44
2. Value = 29
3. Value = 34

Code to check:
1.print(4*(6+5))
2.print(4*6+5)
3.print(4+6*5)

The type of data as a result of 3 + 1.5 + 4 is a float because it has a decimal.

What would you use to find a numbers squareroot, as well as square?
You'd most likely use prime factorisation to find the square root by combining the pairs and then seeing if there are doubles.
If there are doubles, then the digit that is doubles is the squareroot. To get the square, just multiply the number by itself. 

Wrong: Use X**0.5 and X**2



s = "hello"

To get e: print(s[1])

To reverse: print(s[::-1])

Get 0 m1: print(s[4])
Get 0 m2: print(s[-1])

Method 1 = list1 = [0,0,0]
print(list1)
Method 2 = list2 = None
list2.append(0)
list2.append(0)
list2.append(0)
print(list2)

Another method: [0]*3

Reassigning to goodbye: list3[2][2] = "goodbye"

Sort the list = list4.sort()

# Another cool way is by using sorted(list4)

Grab hello = d["simple_key"]
Grab hello = d["k1"]["k2"]
Grab hello = d["k1"][0]["nest_key"][1][0]
Grab hello = d["k1"][2]["k2"][1]["tough"][2][0]

You cannot sort Dictionaries because they're mappings


The major difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are immutable meaning they cannot be moved.
You create them using tuple(). 

What is unique about a set is that it only has unique values in them.

print(set(list5))

Bools:
False, False, False, True, False


Final question: False
