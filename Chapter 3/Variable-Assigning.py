# Example of naming a variable:
my_dogs = 2
# Rules: Cannot start with a number, no spaces in the name, can't use any symbols.
# It's best practice to have lower case names. Avoid having names that are already assigned such as list for example. 
# Python is dynamically typed, meaning that you can reassign variables to different data types. 
my_dogs = ["frankie", "Joe"] # This is fine!
a = 10
a = a + a
print(a)
print(type(a))
